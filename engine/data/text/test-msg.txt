All right, so I woke up at around 9.30, went to the gym at 10, had a pretty intense workout, but didn't feel crazy. Well, I didn't do that much cardio, but it was a good workout. Then I had a big lunch at around 1. That made me feel kind of weird, but a lot of protein. I got some more exercise, but mostly just sat. Oh, and I also read my book for a bit.
